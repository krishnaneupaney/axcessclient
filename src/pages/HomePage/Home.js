        title: "Will checking affect my credit score?",
        content: <p> Checking your rate on Axcess Platform will not affect your credit score. If you proceed with your application after receiving a rate your credit score may be impacted. When you check your rate, we make a "soft credit inquiry." Soft credit inquiries on your report do not lower your credit score, but you may see when you view your report that this inquiry was made. If you are offered a loan and proceed with the application, a "hard credit inquiry" will be completed to verify the accuracy of your application. 
          This action will be recorded as an inquiry on your report and it may impact your credit score. But don't worry, after 2-3 months of good payment history, score will go up! </p>

        title: "Can I pay off my loan early or ask for extension?",
        content: <p>   There is no prepayment penalty for paying off a loan on AxcessFund early. You may pay off part of all of the loan at any time with no fee. 
          By prepaying, you will pay less overall interest because the loan is outstanding for a shorter time. You can certainly ask us if you need more time to pay your bills then then originally selected term!</p>

When you check your rate, we make a "soft credit inquiry." Soft credit inquiries on your report do not lower your credit score, but you may see when you view your report that this inquiry was made. If you are offered a loan and proceed with the application, a "hard credit inquiry" will be completed to verify the accuracy of your application. 
          This action will be recorded as an inquiry on your report and it may impact your credit score. But don't worry, after 2-3 months of good payment history, score will go up! </p>
